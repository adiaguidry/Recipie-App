# Recipie-App


## Overview
This weekly menu maker was built with Javascript OOP and includes an HTTP request. A call is made to a recipie api to display meal ideas on the left side. 

This app tracks your meal ideas for the week, along with whether you have all ingredients on hand. If you do not have all ingredients on hand a shopping list is created if ingredients are not on hand.
